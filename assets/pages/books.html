                <p class="lead">Saithia is the perfect world. It's soil is and has always been rich 
                  and plentiful, its waters and forrests abundant with life, and for those who can sense them, 
                  arcane particles are everywhere. For the past several years, the seven clans of Saithia have 
                  been peaceful. However, The Mages Guild, a secretive order of people who can manipulate the arcane 
                  particles to perfiorm magic, are facing a serious problem; A renagade mage named Taleb.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Jace, heir to the clan of Loring is also facing his own dilemas. He's in love with his best friend, 
                  Valeria, but their relationship is forbidden because she herself is the heir to another clan. 
                  Little does he know he is also being tracked by The Mages Guild because he has recently come into magical 
                  powers of his own, which is extremely rare and dangerous for someone in their early adulthood. A 
                  trait he shares with with the runaway Taleb.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Saithia and its seven clans will soon find itself in the midst of a war that not only ravishes their
                  flawless world but one that spans between the realms. The fate of Saithia and the other worlds will
                  ultimately be decided by either Jace, or Taleb. Who will win The Summoners War?
